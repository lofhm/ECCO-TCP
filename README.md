# ECCO-TCP XML and SGML files


## What is this?

I have taken the [raw XMl and SGML files](http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/texts/ecco_files.html) and fudged them into a directory structure that may or may not make sense. 


## So what is the situtation here?

For each batch release available [at this link](http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/texts/ecco_files.html) I have created a `commit` adding all of the files from that release to the repository. Each commit includes my guess as the date of that release in the commit message. As is probably obvious, I have put the XML files in the xml fold and the SGML files into the sgml folder. Finally, I have added directories containing the header and schema files at the root of this repository. This is probably not a sensible way to organize the repository.


## Why are you doing this

I am trying to explore how the Digital Humanities might best take advantage of Git and GitHub as tools for generating, sharing, and maintaining data, scholarship and knowledge.
